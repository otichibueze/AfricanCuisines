	{\"name\":{\"mainName\":\"Oha Soup\"},\"placeOfOrigin\":\"Nigeria, Igbo\",\"description\":\"Ora (Oha) soup is native to the South Eastern Nigeria. It is a very traditional soup similar to the bitterleaf soup but cooked with Ora leaves. Ora (Oha) Soup is special because the tender ora leaves used in preparing this soup recipe are seasonal unlike their bitterleaf counterpart which can be found all year round. Though it is only the vegetable that distinguishes the Ora Soup and the Bitterleaf Soup, they taste so different that it is hard to believe the difference just one ingredient can make in a recipe.

This cuisine is quite different from "Ofe Akwu" which is a variant found in Igbo culture. The Binis have a
soup from palm fruits similar to "Ofe Aku" in ingredients and manner of preparation.
Banga soup is ceremonially and most preferably eaten with a yellow thick starchy paste from cassava starch called
"Usi" by the Urhobos as well as their Isoko and Okpe kinsmen. Non Urhobos prefer using Eba because eating "Oghwo"
with "Usi" is an indigenous craft (cutting starch with the fingers requires learning; unlike for Eba).

	{\"name\":{\"mainName\":\"Jollof rice\"},\"placeOfOrigin\":\"Western Africa\",\"description\":\"Jollof rice is one of the most common dishes in Western Africa, consumed throughout the regions of Nigeria,
Senegal, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Togo, Liberia, Niger, Mali, Ivory Coast and Cameroon.
In West Africa it is a common favorite at ceremonies such as weddings, graduations and birthday.
There are several regional variations in name and ingredients.[1] In Mali it is called zaamè in Bamanankan,
and is a typical Sunday lunchtime favorite in urban, middle-class families. The name Jollof derives from the
name of the Wolof people,[6] though in Senegal and Gambia the dish is referred to in Wolof as ceebu jën or benachin.
In French-speaking areas, it is called riz au gras. Despite the variations, the dish is "mutually intelligible" across
the region, and has spread along with the diaspora to become the best known African dish outside the continent.

Based on its name, the origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Jolof Empire.
Food and agriculture historian James C. McCann considers this claim plausible given the popularity of rice in the
upper Niger valley, but considers it unlikely that the dish could have spread from Senegal to its current range since
such a diffusion is not seen in "linguistic, historical or political patterns". Instead he proposes that the dish spread
with the Mali empire, especially the Djula tradespeople who dispersed widely to the regional commercial and urban centers,
taking with them economic arts of "blacksmithing, small-scale marketing, and rice agronomy" as well as the religion of Islam.
[2] Marc Dufumier, Emeritus Professor of Agronomy proposes a more recent origin for the dish, which may only have appeared
as a consequence of the colonial promotion of intensive peanut cropping in central Senegal for the French oil industry,
and where commensurate reduction in the planted area of traditional millet and sorghum staples was compensated by forced
imports of broken rice from Southeast Asia.[7] It may then have spread throughout the region through the historical
commercial, cultural and religious channels linking Senegal with Ghana, Nigeria and beyond, many of which continue to
thrive today, such as the Tijāniyyah Sufi brotherhood bringing thousands of West African pilgrims to Senegal annually.

	{\"name\":{\"mainName\":\"Kuli-kuli\"},\"placeOfOrigin\":\"Western Africa\",\"description\":\"Kuli-kuli is a West African food that is primarily made from peanuts.
It is a popular snack in Nigeria, Benin, northern Cameroon and Ghana.
It is often eaten alone or with a mixture of garri, sugar and water popularly called "garri soakings".
It is also eaten with koko, fura, kamu; and is sometimes ground and put into salad.
It is often ground as used as an ingredient for Suya and Kilishi
To make kuli-kuli, peanuts are roasted and then ground into a paste called "Labu".
The paste is then mixed with spices, salt, and sometimes ground pepper.
The paste is stripped of excess oil with water, and made into the desired shape (round balls, cylinders, etc.).
The oil removed in this process is then heated and used to fry the shaped peanut paste until it solidifies.
It is then removed from the oil and allowed to cool down until ready to be eaten.

	{\"name\":{\"mainName\":\"Feijoada\"},\"placeOfOrigin\":\"East Africa\",\"description\":\"Feijoada is a stew of beans with beef and pork. It is commonly prepared in Portugal, Macau, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Timor, Goa, India and Brazil, where it is also considered a national dish. However, the recipe differs slightly from one country to another.
Brazilian feijoada made with black beans
The name comes from feijao, Portuguese for beans. The basic ingredients of feijoada are beans with fresh pork or beef.
In Brazil, it is usually made with black beans (feijoada a brasileira). The stew is best prepared over low heat in a
thick clay pot.It is usually served with rice and assorted sausages such as chourico, morcela (blood sausage),
farinheira, and others, which may or may not be cooked in the stew.
The practice of cooking a meat (pork) stew with vegetables that gave origin to the feijoada from the
Minho Province in Northern Portugal is a millenary Mediterranean tradition that can be traced back to
the period when the Romans colonized Iberia.Roman soldiers would bring this habit to every Latin settlement, i.e.,
all of the provinces of Romania, the Vulgar Latin speaking area of Europe (not to be confused with the modern country solely),
and this heritage is the source of many national and regional dishes of today\'s Europe, such as the French cassoulet,
the Milanese cassoeula from Lombardy, Italy, the Romanian fasole cu carnați, the fabada asturiana from Northwestern Spain,
and the also Spanish cocido madrileno and olla podrida, not to mention non-Romanic regions with similar traditions
that might be derived from this millennial Roman soldiers dish like the Polish tsholem and golonka.
Fasolada, labeled the Greek national dish, is related to the ancient Greek dish of broad beans, vegetables, and grains,
with no meat, unlike the Italian fagiolata and the Portuguese feijoada, which was used as food and sacrifice to
Greek God Apollo during the Pyanopsia festival.
