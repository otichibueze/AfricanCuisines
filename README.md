## Project Overview
This project is used for Mentoring Students in ALC 4.0 Port-Harcourt meet-up 1.0, Student you will complete the African Cuisine app to show the details of each cuisine once it is selected.
 
## Why this Project
Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project will help you to better understand how it is processed.


## What Will I Learn?
- Through this project, you will learn:
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly
- Learn Testing With Espressor

## How Do I Complete this Project?
Download project African Cuisine Starter Code and complete all todo's

Design the layout for the detail activity so the different elements display in a sensible way. Implement the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it produces a Cuisine Object that can be used to populate the UI that you designed.
